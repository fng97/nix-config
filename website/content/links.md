A collection of my favourite resources.

[Driving Compilers](https://fabiensanglard.net/dc/index.php) by Fabien Sanglard is the definitive
crash course on C compilers.
[Floating Point Visually Explained](https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/index.html)
is another favourite of mine.

You have to try this: Julia Evans and Kamal Marhubi's
[Do you know how much your computer can do in a second?](https://computers-are-fast.github.io)
Apparently not! Very fun and humbling.

I really enjoy [Alex Kladov](https://matklad.github.io/about.html)'s writing. Go check it out! If I
had to choose a favourite it would be
[Basic Things](https://matklad.github.io/2024/03/22/basic-things.html) with
[Performance Profile Visualization Challenge](https://matklad.github.io/2025/05/06/performance-profile-visualization-challenge.html)
as the runner-up.

[`less_slow.cpp`](https://github.com/ashvardanian/less_slow.cpp) by Ash Vardanian is an excellent
reference for performance engineering. The best part is it's backed by real benchmarks you run
yourself. I also found
[Mastering C++ with Google Benchmark](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/google-benchmark/) and
[Understanding SIMD](https://www.modular.com/blog/understanding-simd-infinite-complexity-of-trivial-problems)
super useful when I was first getting into performance work.

[My Life in Weeks](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org) is beautiful and terrifying. It visualises the
scale of a lifetime.

[Practical Data Oriented Design](https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c?si=Q7z4dclQTUdWwlGT) by Andrew Kelley
is a must-watch.

[Testing Distributed Systems with Deterministic Simulation](https://youtu.be/4fFDFbi3toc?si=QzVee30XyKRuHzER)
by Will Wilson is the classic talk on deterministic simulation testing.
[The sequel](https://youtu.be/m3HwXlQPCEU?si=rWKFtJOXdEk4szfh) (which features Super Mario Bros) is
super fun too.

Although I have mixed feelings about [Nix](https://nixos.org), the benefits of declarative,
reproducible software are undeniable. If you're going to learn Nix, start with
[Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com).
