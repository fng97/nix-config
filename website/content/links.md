A collection of my favourite resources.

[Driving Compilers](https://fabiensanglard.net/dc/index.php) by Fabien Sanglard is the definitive
crash course on C compilers.
[Floating Point Visually Explained](https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/index.html)
is another favourite of mine.

You have to try this: Julia Evans and Kamal Marhubi's
[Do you know how much your computer can do in a second?](https://computers-are-fast.github.io) Very
fun and humbling.

I really enjoy [Alex Kladov](https://matklad.github.io/about.html)'s writing. Go check it out! If I
had to choose a favourite it would be
[Mechanical Habits](https://matklad.github.io/2025/12/06/mechanical-habits.html).

[`less_slow.cpp`](https://github.com/ashvardanian/less_slow.cpp) by Ash Vardanian is a cheat sheet
for performance engineering backed by real microbenchmarks you run yourself. I also found
[Mastering C++ with Google Benchmark](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/google-benchmark/) and
[Understanding SIMD](https://www.modular.com/blog/understanding-simd-infinite-complexity-of-trivial-problems)
super useful when I was getting started.

[Practical Data Oriented Design](https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c?si=Q7z4dclQTUdWwlGT) by Andrew Kelley
is a must-watch.

[Testing Distributed Systems with Deterministic Simulation](https://youtu.be/4fFDFbi3toc?si=QzVee30XyKRuHzER)
by Will Wilson is the classic talk on deterministic simulation testing.
[The sequel](https://youtu.be/m3HwXlQPCEU?si=rWKFtJOXdEk4szfh) (which features Super Mario Bros) is
super fun too.
