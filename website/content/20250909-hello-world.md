# Hello, world!

Welcome to my blog :)

Next Friday is my last day at work for 12 weeks. I'm taking a break to attend a batch at the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) remotely. Taking a work break has been on my mind for a
while. I have loads of fun working on personal projects: I get to explore domains and technologies
I'd never come across in work and focus on what excites me. I heard about RC in a talk by
[Andrew Kelley](https://andrewkelley.me) (I can't remember which one) and started on my application
the same day. It was clear from their [self-directives](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives)
that we were a good match. Three months of self-guided study alongside a batch of people hungry to
learn - who could turn that down?

Setting up a website has been on my to-do list for ages. I wanted to have a platform for writing set
up before my batch, so here it is! I have always found writing rewarding, but challenging: I can
only write about something if I understand it. I plan to use this blog as a companion to my learning
journey - a check on my understanding. There's also the chance someone will find what I've written
here useful.

I'm still not sure what I'll work on at RC. On one hand, I want to work on a smattering of small
projects across many domains to explore the field. On the other, how often does one get the chance
to pour _months_ into a project of their own? My tentative plan is to do the former for a month or
so until I've found a bigger project worth digging into. Regardless, I know it will be loads of fun.
I'm gonna play with networking, operating systems, cryptography, embedded systems, and more. Even
building this website was _way more fun_ than I'd expected.

Another thing I'm excited about is my change in schedule. RC is based in New York so my working
schedule will be shifted back five hours (I'll start in the afternoon). It's that time of year in
the UK when the waves start getting good and the surf tends to be better and less crowded in the
morning. Gotta make the most of it!

Here we are. Wish me luck!
